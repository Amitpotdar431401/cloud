Here are the steps to create a VPC in AWS with a public and private subnet, launch EC2 instances, and connect to them:

Step 1: Create a VPC
Go to the VPC Dashboard.
Click on Create VPC.
In the "Create VPC" wizard:
Name tag: "MyVPC"
IPv4 CIDR block: 172.20.0.0/16
Leave other options (IPv6, Tenancy) as default.
Click Create VPC.
Step 2: Create Public and Private Subnets
Create the Public Subnet:
Go to the Subnets section.
Click Create subnet.
Select the VPC created in Step 1.
Fill in the details:
Name tag: "PublicSubnet"
Availability Zone: Choose one (e.g., us-east-1a).
CIDR block: 172.20.1.0/24
Click Create subnet.
Create the Private Subnet:
Click Create subnet again.
Select the same VPC.
Fill in the details:
Name tag: "PrivateSubnet"
Availability Zone: Choose the same or different (e.g., us-east-1b).
CIDR block: 172.20.2.0/24
Click Create subnet.
Step 3: Create an Internet Gateway
Go to the Internet Gateways section in the VPC Dashboard.
Click Create internet gateway.
Name tag: "MyInternetGateway".
Click Create and then Attach to VPC.
Select the VPC ("MyVPC") and click Attach.
Step 4: Update Route Tables for Public and Private Subnets
Configure the Public Subnet Route Table:
Go to the Route Tables section.
Select the route table associated with the PublicSubnet.
Click on the Routes tab, then Edit routes.
Add a new route:
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
Target: Select the Internet Gateway created in Step 3.
Click Save routes.
Step 5: Launch EC2 Instance in the Public Subnet
Go to the EC2 Dashboard and click Launch Instance.
Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).
Choose an Instance Type (e.g., t2.micro).
In the Network section, select the VPC ("MyVPC") and Subnet ("PublicSubnet").
In the Configure Security Group section:
Create a new security group or select an existing one.
Add an inbound rule to allow SSH (port 22) from your IP address.
Key Pair: Create a new key pair (.pem) and download/save it; you will need it for SSH.
Click Launch Instance.
Step 6: Launch EC2 Instance in the Private Subnet
Follow the same steps as above to create another EC2 instance in the PrivateSubnet.
Choose the same AMI (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).
In the Network section, select the VPC ("MyVPC") and Subnet ("PrivateSubnet").
Click Launch Instance.
Step 7: Connect to the Public EC2 Instance via SSH (using PuTTY)
Open PuTTY (Windows).
Enter the Public IP of the public EC2 instance.
Under Connection → SSH → Auth, browse to the private key file (in .pem format) for the public EC2 instance and select it.
Click Open to connect to the EC2 instance. You should be logged into the EC2 instance in the PublicSubnet.
Step 8: Transfer the Key to the Public Instance
Use WinSCP to copy the private key file (.pem) to the public EC2 instance.
Drag and drop the .pem file to the public instance.
Step 9: Connect to the Private EC2 Instance
On the public EC2 instance, change the permissions of the key file:
bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
chmod 400 PUBLIC_KEY.pem
SSH into the private EC2 instance using the command:
bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
ssh -i "PUBLIC_KEY.pem" ec2-user@172.20.2.223
